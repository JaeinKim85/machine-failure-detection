# Predictive-Maintance-Model

A requirement to implement a degradation model for an industrial machine and predict the failures beforehand.
Malfunctioning of machines are captured here as anomalies and failures and its related data are captured here as outliers

### Dependencies

- numpy
- scikit-learn > 0.19.1
- pandas > 0.20.3

### Dataset

Data streams from an active two industrial machines in a customer site. Due to the big dataset, it has been embedded in to pickle files to increase the computational efficiency.
