# Predictive-Maintance-Model

A requirement to implement a degradation model for an industrial machine and predict the failures beforehand.
Malfunctioning of machines are captured here as anomalies and failures and its related data are captured here as outliers

### Dependencies

- scikit-learn > 0.19.1
- pandas > 0.20.3
