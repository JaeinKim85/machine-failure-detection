# KeySight-Predictive-Maintance
A requirement to implement a degradation model for an industrial machine and predict the failures beforehand. Currently, PCA and DBSCAN based anomaly detection method for time series has been implemented. Now reading for time series prediction and tracking of outliers using LSTM and CNN, on-going project, funded by Keysight technologies.
